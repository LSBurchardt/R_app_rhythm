# Introduction

This is the manual for the shiny application "RANTO - Rhythm ANalysis TOol for Timeseries". The following section will guide you through the first steps and will show you, how to work with the app.

The [code](https://github.com/LSBurchardt/R_app_rhythm) for the app lies on my github repository.

Who am I? My name is Lara, I am a trained Biologist and did my PhD on rhythm in animals' acoustic signals and how to analyse them at the Museum für Naturkunde Berlin and the Freie Universität Berlin.

I am currently working at the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin, where I have my own DFG-project to develop rhythm analysis methodology further. Currently I am working on different projects to analyse the temporal structures of communication signals, i.e. during development, across languages or time while further improving rhythm analysis methods and their accessibility. 

## Why use this app?

## A little background

The temporal structure of animal communication is a potentially crucial parameter, that historically was often overlooked, especially in mammals and birds. With the development of new methods in recent years, research on rhythm analysis in animal communication is an ever-growing field, with yet many knowledge gaps: we want to identify the adaptive function of rhythms and add this piece of the puzzle to ongoing discussions about the evolution of language and music. Apart from that, the temporal structure of vocalizations can inform about species identity, communication context, arousal state, health conditions, and many more, which has wide implications for a lot of research fields ranging from behavioral ecology and cognitive science to conversation biology, and animal welfare.  (Anichini et al., 2020; Honing & Ploeger, 2012; Honing et al., 2015; Manser, 2001; Ravignani et al., 2019).  

Different parameters can be measured in the context of rhythm analysis, many of which I studied and developed during my doctoral thesis (Burchardt, Briefer, et al., 2021; Burchardt & Knörnschild, 2020). For example, we can calculate simple distributional parameters, such as mean and coefficient of variation of Inter-Onset-Intervals (IOI), the duration between the start of a sound element in a sequence and the start of the next element in that sequence (Figure 1). Furthermore, we can look at ratios between pairs of IOIs in a sequence, this approach has gained a lot of attention in the last years and is used extensively (Roeske et al., 2020; de Gregorio et al., 2021; Osiecka et al., 2024; Eleuteri et al. 2024; Van der Vleuten et al. 2024). 
A possible next step is to describe a single sequence with one particular rhythm or beat in hertz (Hz). A sequence with a rhythm of 5 Hz would have 5 equally distributed sound elements per second, so roughly one sound element every 200 ms. If it is a perfect fit, it is exactly every 200 ms, but in biological systems such ‘perfection’ seldom happens. Beat precision can then be used to describe how good the fit of the actual elements to the calculated theoretical beat is. I will analyze exact beat frequencies to describe a sequence with the so-called IOI approach (Burchardt & Knörnschild, 2020) and I will use the universal goodness-of-fit value , which I developed during my doctoral thesis, to determine the beat precision (Figure 1, called bp throughout). The striking advantages of the bp parameter include that it can be calculated independent of the method used to calculate the exact beats; it is independent of the number of elements, the rhythm it is describing, or any other parameter. Other goodness-of-fit values were correlated to i.e., the number of elements or the rhythm they were describing, making them unfit for comparative work or the general description of beat precision. Another important aspect of the bp parameter is that it can be calculated per sound element and can therefore be investigated on very different levels ranging from single sound elements to long sound sequences. It can be calculated for a single individual, or several individuals of the same species in comparison with another species, making it potentially useful for very different kinds of questions. Individual bp values can range from 0 to 1, with 0 meaning a perfect fit and 1 meaning the element is at the maximum possible deviation it can have from a beat. On a summary scale, a symmetry of values around 0.5 exists, where a summary value of 0.1 means the same as a summary value of 0.9, just in case of a 0.9 bp summary, elements would be phase shifted. Therefore, for the summary per sequence values are transformed accordingly to 0 to 0.5 (Burchardt et al., 2025).

The app calculates all these values and makes them available as results tables to download and plots.

## Preparations

The app runs independent of platforms on Windows, Linux and Mac. No adjustments are needed for any of these. 
A sessionInfo file with detailed information about R versioning and package versions can be found in the Git repository as well. 

### Packages

For the app to work a bunch of packages need to be installed.  The app will automatically check, whether all necessary packages are installed on your local machine, and if not, will install them 
This is an overview of the needed packages, just for your information.  

`install.load` \
`shiny` \
`shiny.Files` \
`shinybusy` \
`shinyjs` \
`shinyWidgets` \
`tidyverse` \
`readxl` \
`vegan` \
`corrplot` \
`plotly` \
`DT` \
`scales` \
`strings`\
`Rcpp`\

### Necessary Code on your machine

To run the app it is easiest to do so in RStudio. 

In the RStudio app, set up new project (`file -> New project`). If you have never used R projects before, see [here](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-RStudio-Projects) for a short explanation of the use and advantageous of R Projects. If you are using a different shell just makes sure that all codes are in the same folder and this folder is set as working directory. 

You now need to download the code from [github](https://github.com/LSBurchardt/R_app_rhythm) into this project folder. This will ensure, that RStudio can access all necessary files and data without any further steps. 

![Alt text](E:/R_App_Rhythm/R projekt/RhythmAnalysis/images_manual/download_code.JPG)
Figure 2: Screenshot of github page to guide code download. 

On the project webpage, you click the green button "Code" and then choose "Download ZIP" (Figure 1) 
This will download the main app codes:

`global.R` \
`ui.R` \
`server.R` \

and the folders `R`, containing helper functions for the app; `www` and  `images_manual` containing necessary files for the app and manual to work. You will also find the folder `test data\csv` with ten test csv files to analyze also showing the necessary structure of input files. More on that later. 

Everything, that you save within the app (i.e., data) will also be saved into the project folder. 

# How to use the app?

## How should the input data look like?

The input data needs to include the relevant event time points you want to calculate rhythms for. This could be starting points of sound elements, end points of sound elements, or time point with peak energy of sound elements, depending on your data and approach. These time points need to be in the first column of a data table input. The app only takes .csv files.
 
The data table can include respective "endpoints" of sound elements, if applicable or element types in a second and third column, but that is not necessary. If you supply element types, it is possible to filter for element types and calculate rhythms element type wise. Elements need to be labeled with letters for this to work. You can distignuish up to 26 element types (a-z). For most datasets distinguishing between 10 element types is enough (a-j), per default only these elements are shown. If you need more element types, click the corresponding button "Show more elements".

A possible example of an input data table is shown below.
 
 Table 1: Exemplary input data table with time points of interest in the first column (here start points), the respective end points and the element type. 

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
	\hline
	start & end & element type\\
	\hline
	0.1 & 0.12 & a\\
	\hline
	0.2 & 0.23 & a\\
	\hline
	0.3 &  0.31 & a\\
	\hline
	0.4 &  0.42 & a\\
	\hline
	0.5 &  0.51 & a\\
	\hline
	0.6 &  0.62 & a\\
	\hline
	0.7 &  0.71 & a\\
	\hline
	0.8 &  0.82 & a\\
	\hline
	0.9 &  0.91 & a\\
	\hline
	1 &  1.01 & a\\
	\hline
\end{tabular}

<!-- Here you can find further examples of input data. (include link here to github data input example --> 


## Starting the app

Before you start the app, your environment should be empty, no datasets should be loaded or values be stored. To make sure it is, run the following code `rm(list = ls)` in the console. WARNING: Only do this, when the respective project is opened! Otherwise you might loose data from other projects, you do not want to remove.   

Open one of the following scripts: `global.R`, `ui.R` or `server.R`. All three scripts together form the app. You can start the app from any of the three files. 

To avoid confusion, it might be easiest to open the `global.R` file, as it is the shortest. Once you open it, on the top right corner you will see the option `Run App` with a green triangle in front of it. If you click on that option, the app will start. 

![Alt text](E:/R_App_Rhythm/R projekt/RhythmAnalysis/images_manual/run_app.JPG)
Figure 3: Where to find the "Run App button" when, i.e. the `global.R` script is opened. 

## Input parameters, Options

When you start the app, a new window will open, that looks like this:

![Alt text](E:\R_App_Rhythm\R projekt\RhythmAnalysis\images_manual\app_empty.JPG)

You can change several inputs.
1. First of all, you can decide, whether Recurrence Plots should be produced, this is a slightly time consuming task, which is why the option is given not to render them.
2. The second input is the sampling rate (FS) you want to choose for the Fourier analysis calculations. The default is 200. Note, that frequencies can be decomposed up to half of the sampling rate. So for the default FS of 200 you would analyse the rhythm in a window between 0 and 100 Hz with the Fourier analysis.
3. As mentioned before, you need to specify the format of your input data. Only one input format can be analysed at a time and you need to specify the correct data type BEFORE choosing the input folder. Changing the format after choosing the input folder will crash the app. 
4. You can select a savename for your data, that will be included in the filename, when you download the results. A savename is not necessary for the app to work properly, but advised to not confuse or overwrite results by accident. 

Potential issues: 
Choosing input elements
-  if you filter element types in a way, that at least one sequence is of length 0, the app will crash
   corresponding error message --> "Error in :: argument of length 0"

## Choose Data to analyse

After choosing all necessary input arguments, you can click the `Choose folder` button, which will open an explorer window, where you select the folder containing your data in the chosen file format such as `csv`. If there is other files in the same folder, with the same file extension, this will lead to errors, so make sure, to have a designated folder for your data. 

After you chose the folder, the data to be analysed will appear in list form in the `Data` Tab (Figure 4).

![Alt text](E:\R_App_Rhythm\R projekt\RhythmAnalysis\images_manual\data_chosen.JPG)



click the "GO" Button to run the analyses on the chosen data. If you want to calculate the results with another sampling rate, change the sampling rate and click "Reset FS" to run the calculations again with the new parameter.  

<!--If you want to analyse a different data set with a different file extension, you need to restart the app. The app will crash, when you change the file extension after having run calculations already. -->



## Analysis and Output


All analyses will run automatically and results will appear in the `Results` Tab. Results will be presented in a table. Visualizations will also be generated for the relevant results parameters. 

It will look something like this:

### Results and Results Table

The following parameters and results are calculated:

1. the IOI beat
  That is the beat frequency in Hertz, that describes the element sequence best, when using the average IOI duration as the       basis for the rhythm calculation. This method is suitable for many datasets. It is suitable for datasets with a low             variability in IOI duration and a general consistency, i.e. because the sequence is not that long, consists of only the same    element type and the temporal structure is very consistent.   
2. the unbiased Coefficient of Variation
  This parameter indicates the variability of IOI durations independent of the sample size and the actual mean it is describing.   The CV sets mean and standard deviation into relation and can be interpreted as a percentage. The higher it is, the higher is   the variability. 
3. the normalized Pairwise Variability Index (nPVI)
  Another variability parameter, originating in linguistics. It indicates how well you can predict one IOI by the preceding      IOI. A value of 0 would indicate, that every IOI in a sequence is exactly equal.
4. the Fourier beat
  That is the beat frequency in Hertz, that describes the element sequence best, when using Fourier analysis to calculate         rhythm. For that, the sequence is first transformed into a binary sequence with th chosen sampling rate. This binary sequence,   where the points of interest (i.e., start point of a sound element) are coded as 1 and everything is 0, is decomposed into its   sinusoidal components with a fast Fourier transformation. Note, that this calculation is strongly influenced by the frequency   resolution of the Fourier analysis. The temporal resolution, i.e., the sampling rate divided by the sample length gives the     frequency resolution. As a rule of thumb: the longer the signal, the smaller is the problem of a coarse frequency resolution.
  In case the frequency resolution is higher, than the actual frequency window, that can be depicted (i.e., sampling rate of 20   Hz, resulting in a frequency window up to 10 Hz, but a frequency resolution of 11 HZ) this value will be given as NA (Figure 7)
  
  ![Alt text](E:/R_App_Rhythm/R projekt/RhythmAnalysis/images_manual/results_exampletable_fourierNA.JPG)
  
  
5. the frequency resolution
  That is the frequency resolution of the Fourier Beat. This is especially important, of you want to interpret the suitability    of the Fourier approach or compare the IOI beat and the Fourier beat. The IOI beat is a continuous value, the Fourier beat      result can only take multiplies of the frequency resolution. Fourier beats of a sequence with a low (i.e. large number)         frequency resolution are to be treated and interpreted carefully. Ideally, the frequency resolution should be <0.5 Hz. 
6. the number of elements
  The number of elements in each sequence is also depicted in the results table.
7. the signal length
  That is the signal length of the binary sequence necessary to calculate the Fourier analysis. It depends on the sampling rate   and the total signal duration and influences the frequency resolution.
8. the universal goodness of fit of the IOI beat
   That is the value, indicating, how well the IOI beat describes the sequence. It can lie between 0 and 1 and can be              interpreted   as a percentage. The lower it is, the better the fit between theoretical beat and actual sound elements. 
9. the universal goodness of fit of the Fourier beat
   That is the same parameter, just calculated for the Fourier beat
   
   
For detailed explanations of the parameters and methods please see: 
1. [Burchardt & Knörnschild, 2020](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007755)
2. [Burchardt et al, 2021](https://doi.org/10.1002/ece3.8417)

Furthermore shown in the results table are: 

10. the sampling rate
  The chosen sampling rate is given in the results table. 
11. the file name
  The file name of the analysed sequence
12. a possible save name   
  If you chose a "savename" in the interface, that will be depicted here as well, for the easier discrimination in possible subsequent analyses. 
  
The very first column of the results table just gives an index number, that can be used for subsequent analyses and can be used in this app, to re-analyze certain parts of a certain sequence.
