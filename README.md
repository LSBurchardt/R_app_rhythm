# R_app_rhythm
This project makes code exessible to conduct rhythm analysis on a time series with an interactive shiny App in R or by using the individual functions directly in R. 

To get started with the App look at the Manual (**manual.pdf**, in the folder **RhythmAnalysis**), there everything from download to use and interpretation of results will be presented. 

Note: This is a work in progress and not all functionalities are finished yet. (November, 2022)
